## Inspiration
Mental health is a very important issue that is often overlooked. We wanted to create a solution that would help people with mental health issues and provide them with solutions to their problems.

## Architecture
We used a streamlit web app to create the front end of our project.
For mental illness detection we used a fine-tuned BERT model with a over 70 000 data points.
For the solutions we used the GPT-3 API to generate solutions to the problems.


## Dataset
We used the [Mental Disorders Identification (Reddit)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamaruladha/mental-disorders-identification-reddit-nlp) dataset from Kaggle.

## Fine-tuning BERT
We used the [BERT]( https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html) model from the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) library.

We ran the training for 2 epochs and the loss went from 1.8 to 0.6

## Solution Generation
We used the [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) API to generate solutions to the problems,but it's recommended to visit a psychologist if you have any mental health issues.
